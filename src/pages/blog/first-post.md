Thesis: It will be hard to stop murder by robot.

As I caught up with the latest season of Mandalorian, I was amused to find a surprisingly contemporaneous problem as the main plot point of chapter 22 (Guns for Hire). The issue: repurposed battle droids have been malfunctioning all around the very wealthy capital of an indepedent planet. Sushi-chef-like droids wielding knives, driver bots crashing cars, and hilarious trash-truck bots mimicking [the famous GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/acttIrNAHaoco/giphy.gif) and throwing garbage everywhere. The protagonists must find out why.

<cite>Google's PaLM-e model [^1]</cite> was already quite impressive being released four days before GPT-4 on March 10. As one of the many advances that have been overshadowed by the OpenAI model's incredible/terrifying/wonderful array of ever-expanding capabilities[^2], the implications of using LLMs for actuation in the physical world have not been as prominent as those of language outputs themselves. Paired with other agents such as HuggingGPT[^3], we are dangerouly close to producing the killer droids of science-fiction.

- Possibilities for droids that follow natural language prompts

- Resolution of the conflict in the show and how it does not apply to the way developments are going
