# 🧑‍🚀 My personal blog

This is my most up-to-date blog, made with [ Astro ]( https://astro.build/ ).

I made this blog by modifying the default template blog, created with:
```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```
This theme is based off of the [Bear Blog](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/).

### Features I am exploring with this Astro template:

- OpenGraph data
- Sitemap support
- RSS Feed support
- MDX support

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
